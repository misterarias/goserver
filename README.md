Go Server
===========

This project is a simple go server that wraps any long-time executable process, and allows native remote monitoring.

It's stupid as hell, but fun for playing with GO, creating packages, tests and the likes.

Since the server supports SSL connections, a simple self-signed certificate-generator tool has been added.
